    Suppose you have a series expansion

    where p_i = order + exponentiation_step * i  and g(h) -> L as h -> 0, but g(0) != L.

    For ``method``='central', that is, for a sequence resulting from a central
    differences derivative approximation, we get ``order`` = 2 and
    ``exponentiation_step`` = 2, which would result in

    where g(h) := [f(x + h) - f(x - h)] / 2h and f the function of interest. See
    function ``_get_order_and_exponentiation_step`` for more details.

    If we evaluate the right hand side for different stepsizes h we can fit a polynomial
    to that sequence of approximations and use the estimated intercept as a better
    approximation for L. Further, we can compute estimation errors of our approximation.

    See function ``richardson_extrapolation`` for more details.

    For different methods, different values of order and exponentiation step apply.
    Consider the following examples, where we continue the notation from function
    ``richardson_extrapolation`` and use O() to denote the Big O Laundau symbol.

    Central Differences.
        Derivative approximation via central difference is given by
            g(h) := [f(x + h) - f(x - h)] / 2h = f'(x) + r(x, h),
        where r(x, h) denotes the remainder term.

        If we expand the remainder term r(x, h) we get
            r(x, h) = a0*(h**2) + a1*(h**4) + a2*(h**6) + ...
        with a0 = f''(x) / 2!, a1 = f'''(x) / 3! etc.

        Rearanging terms we can write L := f'(x) = g(h) - r(x, h) = g(h) + O(h**2) and
        we notice that order = 2 and exponentiation_step = 2.

    Forward Differences.
        Derivative approximation via forward difference is given by
            g(h) := [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h = f'(x) + r(x, h),
            where again r(x, h) denotes the remainder term.

        If we expand the remainder term r(x, h) we get
            r(x, h) = a0*(h**1) + a1*(h**2) + a2*(h**3) + ...
        with a0 = f''(x) / 2!, a1 = f'''(x) / 3! etc.

        Rearanging terms we can write L := f'(x) = g(h) - r(x, h) = g(h) + O(h) and
        we notice that order = 1 and exponentiation_step = 1.

    Backward Differences.
        Analogous to forward differences.
