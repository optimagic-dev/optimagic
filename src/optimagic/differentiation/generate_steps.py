    """Generate steps for finite differences with or without Richardson Extrapolation.

    steps can be used to construct x-vectors at which the function has to be evaluated
    for finite difference formulae. How the vectors are constructed from the steps
    differs between first and second derivative. Note that both positive and negative
    steps are returned, even for one-sided methods, because bounds might make it
    necessary to flip the direction of the method.

    The rule of thumb for the generation of base_steps is:
    - first_derivative: `np.finfo(float).eps ** (1 / 2) * np.maximum(np.abs(x), 0.1)`
    - second_derivative: `np.finfo(float).eps ** (1 / 3) * np.maximum(np.abs(x), 0.1)`
    Where `np.finfo(float).eps` is machine accuracy. This rule of thumb
    is also used in statsmodels and scipy.

    The step generation is bound aware and will try to find a good solution if
    any step would violate a bound. For this, we use the following rules until
    no bounds are violated:

    1. If a one sided method is used, flip to the direction with more distance
        to the bound.
    2. Decrease the base_steps, unless this would mean to go below min_steps. By default
        min_steps is equal to base_steps, so no squeezing happens unless explicitly
        requested by setting a smaller min_step.
    3. Set the conflicting steps to NaN, which means that this step won't be
        usable in the calculation of derivatives. All derivative functions can
        handle NaNs and will produce the best possible derivative estimate given
        the remaining steps. If all steps of one parameter are set to NaN, no
        derivative estimate will be produced for that parameter.

    Args:
        x (numpy.ndarray): 1d array at which the derivative is calculated.
        method (str): One of ["central", "forward", "backward"]
        n_steps (int): Number of steps needed. For central methods, this is
            the number of steps per direction. It is 1 if no Richardson extrapolation
            is used.
        target (str): One of ["first_derivative", "second_derivative"]. This is used to
            choose the appropriate rule of thumb for the base_steps.
        base_steps (numpy.ndarray, optional): 1d array of the same length as x.
            base_steps * scaling_factor is the absolute value of the first (and possibly
            only) step used in the finite differences approximation of the derivative.
            If base_steps * scaling_factor conflicts with bounds, the actual steps will
            be adjusted. If base_steps is not provided, it will be determined according
            to a rule of thumb as long as this does not conflict with min_steps.
        scaling_factor (numpy.ndarray or float): Scaling factor which is applied to
            base_steps. If it is an numpy.ndarray, it needs to have the same shape as x.
            scaling_factor is useful if you want to increase or decrease the base_step
            relative to the rule-of-thumb or user provided base_step, for example to
            benchmark the effect of the step size.
        lower_bounds (numpy.ndarray): 1d array with lower bounds for each parameter.
        upper_bounds (numpy.ndarray): 1d array with upper bounds for each parameter.
        step_ratio (float or array): Ratio between two consecutive Richardson
            extrapolation steps in the same direction. default 2.0. Has to be larger
            than one. step ratio is only used if n_steps > 1.
        min_steps (numpy.ndarray): Minimal possible step sizes that can be chosen to
            accommodate bounds. Needs to have same length as x. By default min_steps is
            equal to base_steps, i.e step size is not decreased beyond what is optimal
            according to the rule of thumb.

    Returns:
        steps (namedtuple): Namedtuple with the field names pos and neg. Each field
            contains a numpy array of shape (n_steps, len(x)) with the steps in
            the corresponding direction. The steps are always symmetric, in the sense
            that steps.neg[i, j] = - steps.pos[i, j] unless one of them is NaN.
