    This plot answers the question: What percentage of problems can each algorithm
    solve within a certain runtime budget?

    The runtime budget is plotted on the x axis and the share of problems each
    algorithm solved on the y axis.

    Thus, algorithms that are very specialized and perform well on some share of
    problems but are not able to solve more problems with a larger computational budget
    will have steep increases and then flat lines. Algorithms that are robust but slow,
    will have low shares in the beginning but reach very high.

    Note that failing to converge according to the given stopping_criterion and
    precisions is scored as needing an infinite computational budget.

    For details, see the description of performance and data profiles by
    Moré and Wild (2009).

    Args:
        problems (dict): estimagic benchmarking problems dictionary. Keys are the
            problem names. Values contain information on the problem, including the
            solution value.
        results (dict): estimagic benchmarking results dictionary. Keys are
            tuples of the form (problem, algorithm), values are dictionaries of the
            collected information on the benchmark run, including 'criterion_history'
            and 'time_history'.
        runtime_measure (str): "n_evaluations" or "walltime".
            This is the runtime until the desired convergence was reached by an
            algorithm. This is called performance measure by Moré and Wild (2009).
        normalize_runtime (bool): If True the runtime each algorithm needed for each
            problem is scaled by the time the fastest algorithm needed. If True, the
            resulting plot is what Moré and Wild (2009) called data profiles.
        stopping_criterion (str): one of "x_and_y", "x_or_y", "x", "y". Determines
            how convergence is determined from the two precisions.
        x_precision (float or None): how close an algorithm must have gotten to the
            true parameter values (as percent of the Euclidean distance between start
            and solution parameters) before the criterion for clipping and convergence
            is fulfilled.
        y_precision (float or None): how close an algorithm must have gotten to the
            true criterion values (as percent of the distance between start
            and solution criterion value) before the criterion for clipping and
            convergence is fulfilled.
        template (str): The template for the figure. Default is "plotly_white".
