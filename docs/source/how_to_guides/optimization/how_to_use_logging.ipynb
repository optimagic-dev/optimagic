    "Estimagic can keep a persistent log of the parameter and criterion values tried out by an optimizer. For this we use an sqlite database, which makes it easy to read from and write to the log-file from several processes or threads. Moreover, it is possible to retrieve data from the log-file without ever loading it into memory, which might be relevant for very long running optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log-file is updated instantly when new information becomes available. Thus, no data is lost when an optimization has to be aborted or a server is shut down for maintenance.\n",
