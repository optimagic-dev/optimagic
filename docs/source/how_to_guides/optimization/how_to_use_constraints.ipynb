    "\n",
    "`minimize` and `maximize` can take a list with any number of constraints. A constraint in estimagic is a dictionary. The following keys are mandatory for all types of constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``\"loc\"`` or ``\"query\"`` but not both: This will select the subset of parameters to which the constraint applies. If you use \"loc\", the corresponding value can be any expression that is valid for ``DataFrame.loc``. If you are not familiar with these methods, check out our `tutorial on selecting parameters <selecting_parameters.ipynb>`_.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ``\"type\"``: This can take any of the following values:\n",
    "- **\"fixed\"**: The selected parameters are fixed to a value.\n",
    "- **\"probability\"**: The selected parameters sum to one and are between zero and one.\n",
    "- **\"increasing\"**: The selected parameters are increasing.\n",
    "- **\"decreasing\"**: The seletced parameters are decreasing.\n",
    "- **\"equality\"**: The selected parameters are equal to each other.\n",
    "- **\"pairwise_equality\"**: Several sets of parameters are pairwise equal to each other.\n",
    "- **\"covariance\"**: The selected parameters are variances and covariances.\n",
    "- **\"sdcorr\"**: The selected parameters are standard deviations and correlations.\n",
    "- **\"linear\"**: The selected parameters satisfy a linear constraint with equality or\n",
    "  inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of constraint, some additional entries in the constraint dictionary might be required. The details are explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show you how to specify constraints with simplified examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the simpler constraints, we re-use the completely made up params DataFrame we used to explain how to select parameters on the previous page. If you are unfamiliar with `DataFrame.loc` and `DataFrame.query` make sure that your read this explanation first!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other examples are inspired by real projects. In any case, you don't have to understand any of the examples in detail. Just look at the index of their ``params`` DataFrame to see how you can use the constraints in your own projects. "
