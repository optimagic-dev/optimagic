    "This tutorial shows why optimization is difficult and why you need some knowledge in order to solve optimization problems efficiently. It is meant for people who have no previous experience with numerical optimization and wonder why there are so many optimization algorithms and still none that works for all problems. For each potential problem we highlight, we also give some ideas on how to solve it. \n",

    "- The only algorithms that are guaranteed to solve all problems are grid search or other algorithms that evaluate the criterion function almost everywhere in the parameter space.\n",
    "- If you have more than a hand full of parameters, these methods would take too long.\n",

    "\n",
    "Derivative based methods do not try to evaluate the criterion function everywhere in the search space. Instead, they start at some point and go \"downhill\" from there. The gradient of the criterion function indicates which direction is downhill. Then there are different ways of determining how far to go in that direction. The time it takes to evaluate a derivative increases at most linearly in the number of parameters. Using the derivative information, optimizers can often find an optimum with very few function evaluations."
