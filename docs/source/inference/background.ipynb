    "Maximum-likelihood estimation seeks to maximize the likelihood function, defined as a function of an unknown parameter vector, **$\\beta$** , conditional on the data provided. For simplicity, we represent such a function as: $$L(\\beta|y_j, x_j)$$ where $y_j$ is the observed outcome variable for observation $j$ from the sample data and $x_j$ is the $j$th row of covariates for the same observation. Specifically, the function is called the **joint probability density** since the probability density function for each observation is seen as independent of one another and the distribution from which the observed outcome variable is generated stays the same for each observation [2]; thus, we seek to maximize the product of the densities $$ L(\\beta|y_j, x_j) = \\prod_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j| x_j, \\beta) $$ In practice, independence between observations might not hold or observations are weighted. For these deviations, we maximize the **pseudolikelihood function**, which provides good estimates of the parameters by using an approximation of the true joint probability density. Furthermore, the log of the pseudolikelihood function is used because it is simpler to maximize. The logarithm is a monotonic transformation, thus the parameters that maximize the product of the densities will also maximize the sum of the log-likelihoods. $$\\ln L(\\beta|y_j, x_j) = \\sum^n_{j=1} \\ln f(y_j|x_j, \\beta) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the densities is equal to the product of the densities when observations are independent. Deviation implies the sum is an *approximation* of the true likelihood. The functional form of $f$ depends on the distribution of the disturbance or outcome variable from the estimation model. For the present documentation, we consider the logistical distribution (logit) and the normal distribution (probit). These distirbutions work best for bounded outcome variables, where the probability of observing an outcome lies between 0 and 1 and the sum of the probabilities is equal to 1. "

    "To find the vector of parameters which maximize the log-pseudolikelihood function, we take first order conditions of the likelihood with respect to the parameter vector: $$G(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\sum^n_{j=1} \\frac{\\partial \\ln L(\\hat{\\beta}|y_j, x_j)}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}} = 0$$ The partial derivative of the log-likelihood for all observations with respect to the vector of parameters makes the **score vector** and we express the sum over all scores as $G(\\hat{\\beta})$. The existence of a global maximum depends on the shape of the function we are estimating and the parameter space. When the parameter space is compact and the log-likelihood is continuous on that space (i.e. for all parameter values, the log-likelihood returns a value), then a maximum exists. When the parameter space is convex and the log-likelihood f is strictly concave on the set of parameters, then there is a unique set of parameters which maximize the likelihood. \n",

    "To generate the parameters which maximize the log-likelihood function, we use Estimagic's `maximize` functionality. For maximum-likelihood estimations, there is not always a closed-form solution; thus, numerical optimization is requisite in estimating the set of parameters. To estimate, there are several methods, specified [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic/blob/master/estimagic/optimization/algo_dict.json). We use the L-BFGS-B algorithm. Running the algorithm returns a set of parameters which maximize the log-pseudolikelihood. "

The strata given this information would be the combinations: (old, low-income), (old, high-income), (young, low-income), and (young, high-income).
