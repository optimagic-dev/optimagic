    "# How to Benchmark Optimization Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking optimization algorithms is an important step when developing a new algorithm or when searching for an algorithm that is good at solving a particular problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, benchmarking constists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the test problems (or get pre-implemented ones)\n",
    "2. Define the optimization algorithms and the tuning parameters you want to try\n",
    "3. Run the benchmark\n",
    "4. Plot the results\n",
    "\n",
    "optimagic helps you with all of these steps!"
