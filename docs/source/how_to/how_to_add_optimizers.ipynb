    "# How to add optimizers to optimagic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a hands-on guide that shows you how to use custom optimizers with optimagic or\n",
    "how to contribute an optimizer to the optimagic library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have many [examples of optimizers](https://github.com/optimagic-dev/optimagic/tree/main/src/optimagic/optimizers) that are already part of optimagic and you can learn a lot from looking at \n",
    "those. However, only looking at the final results might be a bit intimidating and does\n",
    "not show the process of exploring a new optimizer library and gradually developing a \n",
    "wrapper. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is there to fill the gap. It tells the story of how the `pygmo_gaco`\n",
    "optimizer was added to optimagic by someone who was unfamiliar with pygmo or the \n",
    "gaco algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of adding an algorithm are roughly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand how to use the algorithm**: Play around with the algorithm you want to \n",
    "add in a notebook and solve some simple problems with it. Only move on to the next step \n",
    "after you have a solid understanding.\n",
    "2. **Understand how the algorithm works**: Read documentation,\n",
    "research papers and other resources to find out why this algorithm was created and what \n",
    "problems it is supposed to solve really well. \n",
    "3. **Implement the minimal wrapper**: Learn about the `om.mark.minimizer` decorator as \n",
    "well as the `om.InternalOptimizationProblem` and the `om.Algorithm` classes. Implement a \n",
    "minimal version of your wrapper and test it.\n",
    "4. **Complete and refactor the wrapper**: Make sure that all convergence criteria, \n",
    "stopping criteria, and tuning parameters the algorithm supports can be passed to your \n",
    "wrapper. Also check that the algorithm gets everything it needs to achieve maximum \n",
    "performance (e.g. closed form derivatives and batch function evaluators). Now is also \n",
    "the time to clean-up and refactor your code, especially if you wrap multiple optimizers \n",
    "from a library.\n",
    "5. **Align the wrapper with optimagic conventions**: Use harmonized names wherever \n",
    "a convention exists. Think about good names everywhere else. Set stopping criteria \n",
    "similar to other optimizers and try to adhere to our design philosophy when it comes \n",
    "to tuning parameters. \n",
    "6. **Integrate your code into optimagic**: Learn how to add an optional dependency to \n",
    "optimagic, where you need to put your code and how to add tests and documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gen AI Policy \n",
    "\n",
    "It is ok to use GenAI and AI based coding assistants to speed up the process of adding \n",
    "an optimizer to optimagic. They can be very useful for step 1 and 2. However, AI models \n",
    "often fail completely when filling out the arguments of `om.mark.minimizer`, when you \n",
    "ask them to come up with good names for tuning parameters or when you auto-generate the \n",
    "documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our policy is therefore:\n",
    "1. Only use AI for drafts that you double-check; Never rely on AI producing correct results \n",
    "2. Be transparent about your use of AI \n",
    "\n",
    "We will reject all Pull Requests that violate this policy. "
