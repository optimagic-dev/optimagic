    "# How to select a local optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide explains how to choose a local optimizer that works well for your problem. \n",
    "Depending on your [strategy for global optimization](how_to_globalization.ipynb) it \n",
    "is also relevant for global optimization problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Important facts \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no optimizer that works well for all problems \n",
    "- Making the right choice can lead to enormous speedups\n",

    "## The three steps for selecting algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm selection is a mix of theory and experimentation. We recommend the following \n",
    "four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Theory**: Based on the properties of your problem, start with 3 to 5 candidate algorithms. \n",
    "You may use the [decision tree below](link)\n",
    "2. **Experiments**: Run the candidate algorithms for a small number of function \n",
    "evaluations and compare the results in a *criterion plot*. As a rule of thumb, use \n",
    "between `n_params` and `10 * n_params` evaluations. \n",
    "3. **Optimization**: Re-run the algorithm with the best results until \n",
    "convergence. Use the best parameter vector from the experiments as start parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk you through the steps in an [example](algo-selection-example-problem)\n",
    "below. These steps work well for most problems but sometimes you need \n",
