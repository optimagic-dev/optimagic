    "\n",
    "Often, optimizers try quite extreme parameter vectors, which then can raise errors in your criterion function or derivative. Often, there are simple tricks to make your code more robust. Avoiding errors is always better than dealing with errors after they occur.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid to take ``np.exp`` without further safeguards. With 64 bit floating point numbers, the exponential function is only well defined roughly between -700 and 700. Below it is 0, above it is inf. Sometimes you can use ``scipy.special.logsumexp`` to avoid unsafe evaluations of the exponential. Read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogSumExp) for background information on the logsumexp trick.\n",
    "- Set bounds for your parameters that prevent extreme parameter constellations.\n",
    "- Use the ``bounds_distance`` option with a not too small value for ``covariance`` and ``sdcorr`` constraints.\n",
    "- Use `optimagic.utilities.robust_cholesky` instead of normal\n",
    "  cholesky decompositions or try to avoid cholesky decompositions.\n",
    "- Use a less aggressive optimizer. Trust region optimizers like `fides` usually choose less extreme steps in the beginnig than line search optimizers like `scipy_bfgs` and `scip_lbfgsb`. \n",

    "## Do not use clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly chosen solution to numerical problems is clipping of extreme values. Naive clipping leads to flat areas in your criterion function and can cause spurious convergence. Only use clipping if you know that your optimizer can deal with flat parts. "

    "### How does the magic work\n",
    "\n",
    "When an error occurs and `error_handling` is set to `\"continue\"`, optimagic replaces your criterion with a dummy function (and adjusts the derivative accordingly). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dummy function has two important properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its value is always higher than criterion at start params. \n",
    "2. Its slope guides the optimizer back towards the start parameters. I.e., if you are minimizing, the direction of strongest decrease is towards the start parameters; if you are maximizing, the direction of strongest increase is towards the start parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when hitting an undefined area, an optimizer can take a few steps back until it is in better territory and then continue its work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the optimizer will not simply go back to a previously evaluated point (which would just lead to cyclical behavior). It will just go back in the direction it originally came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the concrete example, the dummy function would look similar to the following:"
